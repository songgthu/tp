| **Parameter** | The additional information you provide for the instruction you intend to enter. |

#### Command format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are **compulsory parameters** to be supplied.<br>

  E.g., you are to provide the `CLASS_NAME` in `add /c CLASS_NAME` command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` enclosed in square brackets are **optional parameters**. <br>
  
  E.g., you can choose to provide either `CLASS_NAME`, `MEMO` and `SCHEDULE` in the `edit /c CLASS_INDEX [/n CLASS_NAME] [/m MEMO] [/t SCHEDULE]` command.

* **Optional parameters** can be in any order.<br>

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
ignored.<br>

  E.g., you enter the command `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a **PDF version** of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. When attempting to view a long string of text, the text may be truncated with "..." at the end. The remedy is to resize the window to be larger if possible.
3. When the window size is too small, the alignment of the columns when viewing a class may be off. The remedy is to resize the window to be larger if possible.
